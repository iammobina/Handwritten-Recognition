# Handwritten Recognition

Due to the significant growth and importance of research in the three areas of computer vision, deep neural networks and natural language processing, we are witnessing the achievements of these three areas, each of them is trying to solve problems or Make things easier for humans.
Converting Persian texts form images to text is always one of the common challenges in the mentioned fields. This challenge will be much more difficult when the text is handwritten, because the complexity and variety of handwritten texts is much greater than typed texts.

Unfortunately, this issue is twofold in Persian handwritten because, first of all, the words can write stuck together, secondly, the existence of dots and appendages makes the letters more difficult. For this reason, the recognition rate in identifying Persian handwritten letters is very low and a slight improvement in this area can be very effective. Now this project is trying to use the strategies used in artificial intelligence and neural networks to convert the pages containing the handwritten letters images to text and improve the recognition accuracy.

This repository contains my thesis project concerning the classification of Arabic handwritten characters, as well as Persian handwritten characters.
